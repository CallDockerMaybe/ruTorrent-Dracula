# ruTorrent-Dracula
The code was originally based on [ruTorrent Material Design](https://github.com/phlooo/ruTorrent-MaterialDesign) and the color scheme was inspired by [Dracula Theme](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme). The CSS and JS is still pretty messy in some places, but it's definitely usable and for the most part complete. A bunch of plugins aren't themed yet, mainly because I don't use them. In addition, all images have been replaced with icons from FontAwesome.
